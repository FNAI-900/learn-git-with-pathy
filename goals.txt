I learned the basics of the tools we will use, such as Git and VS Code, including how to install them and prepare Git for use. I understood what Version Control is, why we need it, the difference between Git and GitHub, and their importance for developers.

I also learned how to use the Command Line to navigate between files and folders, create and organize them, and I understood the difference between absolute and relative paths. Finally, I learned how to create a project using Git, track and save changes, connect the project to GitHub, and upload it there.
